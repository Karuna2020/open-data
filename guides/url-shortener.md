We've set up a URL shortener so we send out pretty links in marketing material. The URL shortener is available on GitHub in the repository [Karuna2020/go](https://github.com/Karuna2020/go).

## Overview

The base URL for the URL shortener is https://go.karuna2020.org. The redirect for `volunteer`, for example, is https://go.karuna2020.org/volunteer, which redirects to the volunteer sign up form.

## Add or remove a URL

To add or remove a URL, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/Karuna2020/go/issues/new/choose
2. Click on "Get started" next to "Add URL" or "Remove URL"
3. Replace "shortened_url" with the URL slug
4. Replace "long_url" with the full URL you want to redirect to
5. Click on "Submit new issue"

Our GitHub Actions bot will add the new URL, and it will be available in a few moment.
