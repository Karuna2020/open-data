## Dry Ration Kit

A dry ration kit is enough for a family of 4-5 and can be assembled using the following ingredients:

| Item                              | Quantity |
| --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Rice                              | 10kg     |
| Dal (mix 2 or 3 varieties)        | 2kg      |
| Salt                              | 1kg      |
| Haldi-Chilli-Dhaniya Powder Combo | 200gms   |
| Mustard/Palm Oil                  | 1ltr     |
| Soap Bar (for washing hands)      | 4        |

In case of families larger than 5, 1 kit to be distrubted for every 5 members, ie:
|Number of family members|Kits to distribute|
|---|---|
|0-5|1|
|6-10|2|
|11-15|3|

There can be cases where people start hoarding multiple kits. Request verification from on-ground volunteers/ distributors before distribution. If verification is not available, trust the on-site volunteer and request for picture proofs of distribution. Our job is to be only as efficient as possible.

| ----------------- | -------- |
| Mask              | 10       |
