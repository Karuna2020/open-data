*NOTE: This guide is currently under review and is likely to change.* 
We owe to our donors to communicate the impact of their donations in a transparent and orderly fashion. 
To achieve this, we should try our best to communicate updates at the following intervals:

# Daily

These updates should be processed everyday.

## Well Wishers and Social Media

We want our donors to stay updated with daily progress

- Make a list of major progress, including but not limited to:
    - Funds Raised
    - Distributions completed
    - Distributions planned
    - Major Partnerships formed
- Share this on central channel for approval
- Edit and include any suggestions
- Send it to well wishers group
- Post an insta story - This will also post to facebook automatically

## Internal Updates

Create minutes of internal meetings and note down:

- Current targets
- Current problems
- Ideas and Experiences

## Con-call story goes to IG and FB

Click a picture of as many people as possible, while on the call and post it to Instagram

# As need be

## Funds raised

Create a video using the Canva template to share on FB and Insta, to communicate the impact of funds raised so far
