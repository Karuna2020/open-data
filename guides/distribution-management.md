_NOTE: This guide is a work in progress and likely to change._

Our job as an organisation to ensure that we reach the needy in the most efficient way. This includes making sure that:
- our distributions don't overlap with other NGOs
- people don't start hoarding our supplies and 
- the real beneficiary is not denied of ration


We follow a three fold process to ensure this:
1. **Verification** We try our best to get a list of beneficiaries with atleast a phone number, address, aadhar number, or any other Government Id.
2. **Proofs of distribution** Each distributor is requried to click pictures of beneficiaries. These pictures are made public.
3. **Feedback** We call random beneficiaries to inquire about their kits and incorporate feedback


This process doesn't ensure 100% efficiency, but we have seen that people who are in real need will be willing to take the pain of getting themselves verified and producing proofs of distribution. 

In some cases, either or all of the above information might not be available. The general guideline is to figure out the relation with the distributor. If ther person/team on ground is someone we trust, we'll go ahead regardless.

# Capturing Requests

Requests generally come in via WhatsApp. All volunteers are encouraged to raise requests they discovered in their community. Requests are also syncronised with other NGOs and support groups. Kripa handles this syncronisation. Requests can also come from existing donors and the website using the [Distribution Request Form](https://go.karuna2020.org/request).

In case a request was not from the website, a card should be added manually to Airtable. This responsibilty lies on distribution managers. The distribution manager should also assign a handler to each request (it's a field on the card).

In case a request came from the website, a card will be created automatically and any distribution manager can assign herself as a handler.
