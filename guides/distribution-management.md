_NOTE: This guide is a work in progress and likely to change._

Our job as an organisation to ensure that we reach the needy in the most efficient way. This includes making sure that:
- our distributions don't overlap with other NGOs
- people don't start hoarding our supplies and 
- the real beneficiary is not denied of ration


We follow a three fold process to ensure this:
1. **Verification** We try our best to get a list of beneficiaries with atleast a phone number, address, aadhar number, or any other Government Id.
2. **Proofs of distribution** Each distributor is requried to click pictures of beneficiaries. These pictures are made public.
3. **Feedback** We call random beneficiaries to inquire about their kits and incorporate feedback


This process doesn't ensure 100% efficiency, but we have seen that people who are in real need will be willing to take the pain of getting themselves verified and producing proofs of distribution. 

In some cases, either or all of the above information might not be available. The general guideline is to figure out the relation with the distributor. If ther person/team on ground is someone we trust, we'll go ahead regardless.

# Capturing Requests

Requests generally come in via WhatsApp. All volunteers are encouraged to raise requests they discovered in their community. Requests are also syncronised with other NGOs and support groups. Kripa handles this syncronisation. Requests can also come from existing donors and the website using the [Distribution Request Form](https://go.karuna2020.org/request).

In case a request was not from the website, a card should be added manually to Airtable. This responsibilty lies on distribution managers. The distribution manager should also assign a handler to each request (it's a field on the card).

In case a request came from the website, a card will be created automatically and any distribution manager can assign herself as a handler.

# Seek verification/ Lists
We generally receive pictures of handwritten beneficiaries with their names, phone numbers, no. of family members, address and a Govt. issued ids. We can relax verification if the on-ground distributor is a part of our team, ex: Gulmeher. We can also relax verification if we trust the person on ground.

Sometimes we also receive pictures of Aadhar cards of the beneficiaries. All these pictures are stored in Airtable.

Once a list a received, we need to figure out our on-ground distribution support. You might have to contact the person who raised the request or a beneficiary to figure this out.

## Past experience/ Learning
If we receive a list for say 200 people, but there are 500 people that need support, then the distibution have a high probability to turn into a stampede. It's advisable to figure out the actual demand and the raised demand. If there is a difference between the two, try to resolve it or drop the reqwuest.

# Checking Stock
Once a list is received, we need to determine the number of kits needed and if we can fulfill the requirement. 

The rule of thumb is to give one kit for every 5 people. You can learn more about the kit at [Ration and Safety Kit Assembly Guide](https://karuna2020.org/guides/ration-and-safety-kit-assembly/#dry-ration-kit).

After determining this number, we need to figure out if we can fulfill this supply. We generally procure material in batches of 1000 kits. You can easily figure out how many kits have been delivered, and subtract it from the current batch\*1000. 

Talk to Shivek or any other procurement manager about this.

# Approving Requests
If we have the stock, a list and on-ground support, we just inform on the group and approve the request. Before approving, confirm if the on-ground distributor can provide us proofs of distribution pictures.

# Coordinating Delivery
Talk to the Godown manager to confirm if the number of required kits are ready at the godown. Then talk to Atul ji to arrange transportation. Also inquire the requestor, if they can arrange for transportation. 

# Requesting Proofs of Distribution
Once a distribution is complete, we expect to receive proofs. It's the duty of the distribution manager to followup for these proofs. We have observed in the past that, if we clear the communication at the initial stages, the on-ground person/ team generally sends the proofs pro-actively.

On receipt of these proofs, we need to blur faces and addresses to protect identity of the individuals. You can do this yourself by following the [Face Blur and Identity Protection Guide](https://karuna2020.org/guides/face-blur-and-identity-protection/) or request support from Shivek or Anand.

# Social Media Outreach
After the proofs are blurred and uploaded, we need to create an outreach post for various social channels. To do this, simply create a card in Social Media Outreach table and links this distribution to that card. A person from the Social Media team will pick it up then.
