We aim to be transparent and communicate the impact of each donation to the donor. For this, we need to ensure that they are connected to us on various channels. This serves as good will and might lead to referral donations.
Apart from establishing connections, we also need to generate receipts. This process is likely to change after the migration of our accounting system.
The current process is managed on Airtable. Ask for access if you don’t have it already:


1. Anurag/ Vikrant add a record from txns using Donor Form (Not available publicly)
2. Card will show up in **Uncategorised Column**
3. Send the following SMS and move card to **Sent SMS Column**
    1. “Hi #Name, Thanks and gratitude for your donation of Rs. 32000/- to[ ++Karuna2020.org++](http://karuna2020.org/). A volunteer will call you shortly to arrange a receipt.”
4. After sending the SMS, call them up:
    1. Introduce yourself, "Hi, this is Shivek Khurana, a volunteer at Karuna 2020"
    2. Thank them for donating to a noble cause, "Thank you for your donation."
    3. Intimate that we are in the process of generating a receipt for them, “We are creating a receipt for your donation.”
    4. Request for PAN, "Would you like to share your PAN to avail 80G tax benefits?"
    5. If they choose to share their PAN, also ask for their address. This is needed to generate an 80G receipt.
    6. Get their PAN and Address and update on the card
    7. Move the card to **Ready for Generating Receipt Column**
    8. Get receipts from Archana, attach them to the card
    9. Send receipts via WhatsAPP
    0. Send another message, requesting them to join the well wishers group and facebook/ instagram page. “Your receipt has been generated. If you’d like to see how your donations impacted lives on ground, please join our well-wishers whatsapp group. You can also follow us on Instagram and Facebook. Thanks again for your support.”
    1. Move the card to **Completed Column**
